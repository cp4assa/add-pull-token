Need to add a pull token/secret to your Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster?

If you head to registry.redhat.io and click on service accounts then you can get a pull token for your account. You will want to go to the Docker Configuration tab and click on "view its contents". you want to grab the `auth` section which is a base64 encoded string with your login. You can then insert your token into this daemonset and apply it to your cluster to add it to your cluster.Â

In addition you will want to add your token for the samples operator. You can get the username and token values from the `Docker Login` tab of the Red Hat registry web site...
```
oc -n openshift-config create secret docker-registry pull-secret --docker-server=registry.redhat.io --docker-username="<registry user>" --docker-password="<token>" --docker-email=<email>
```
