Need to add a pull token/secret to your Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster?

If you head to registry.redhat.io and click on service accounts then you can get a pull token for your account. You will want to go to the Docker Configuration tab and click on "view its contents". you want to grab the `auth` section which is a base64 encoded string with your login. You can then insert your token into this daemonset and apply it to your cluster to add it to your cluster.Â
